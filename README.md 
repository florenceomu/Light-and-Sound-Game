## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
N/A

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
A challenge I encountered was trying to figure out what every single line of the code meant and how it contributed to what was displayed. 
I also wanted to learn more about certain things like CSS Inheritance Reference, Selector Reference and JavaScript’s events, so I spent more time reading more about those topics to fully understand them. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Creating this game was very interesting and it was my first exposure to JavaScript. 
It made me wonder how much more I could do with JavaScript and how versatile it could be and web development as a whole.



4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would definitely spend more time working on the additional features, especially on speeding the game up because 
I know it would have been more fun if it were more challenging over time.
